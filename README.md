This repository demonstrates balanced binary search tree (BST) implementation in JavaScript, which includes functionalities like inserting,
deleting, and traversing nodes, as well as ensuring the tree remains balanced. The 3 primary modules in this repository: Node, Tree, and Driver Script.

# Node

A class that represents an individual node in the binary search tree.

# Tree

A class that represents the binary search tree itself, offering various methods for insertion, deletion, searching, and balancing.

# Driver Script

A script that demonstrates the creation, traversal, unbalancing, and rebalancing of the tree.
